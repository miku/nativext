Notes on exceptions.

> Exception information is stored in three members of the interpreterâ€™s thread
> state. These are NULL if there is no exception. Otherwise they are the C
> equivalents of the members of the Python tuple returned by sys.exc_info().
> These are the exception type, exception instance, and a traceback object.

* `PyErr_SetString`
